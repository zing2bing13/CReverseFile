# CReverseFile
C Program to read a text file and reverse its contents.  Top becomes bottom, bottom becomes top, and each line is also reversed, right to left becomes left to right.

Reverse order means that each line in the file will have its characters reversed and the line order will
also be reversed.

So, this:

abcdefghij
1234567890
aa bbcc dd
0987654321

Becomes this:

1234567890
dd ccbb aa
0987654321
jihgfedcba
